                    I use these to change my PC's system sounds and my phone's ringtones <br> <br> <br>

                    &gt; In the game it plays when opening some doors to facilities run by the enemy faction: the Combine! &lt; <br>

                    &gt; When Half-Life 2 was released, there was a menu option to contact your friends from within the game. &lt; <br>
                    &gt; This feature is now deprecated, and has been replaced by the Friends & Chat feature in the Steam UI. &lt; <br>
                    &gt; I have this sound set to play when I connect a device to my computer system. &lt;

                    &gt; It is supposed to sound like a walkee-talkee, which is what they use to communicate to each other. &lt; <br>
