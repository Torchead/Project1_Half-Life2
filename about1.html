                    Hello! <br> <br>
                    This page is part of a small project for my Web Development class. <br>
                    I intend to build upon it in the future, since I've been inspired by a lot of the Neocity websites I've been seeing.
                </p>

                    The color scheme was devised in part by a friend who has much better design skills than I, but was also derived from the colors from Half-Life 2. <br>
                    I use the original sounds from HL2 to personalize my computer and phone. I used to play HL2 mods and source games a lot and really like the sound design.

                    The images are able to play sounds through some light Javascripting. <br>
                    They are scripted to play a sound in the event that the pictures are clicked.

                    I may have gone a little overboard making this website, but that is because I've been wanting to make one for a few months/years now so I figured this was a good excuse to start! <br> <br>
                    I hope the font is not hard on the eyes, I was trying to go for a retro-digital look but I have limited access to fonts at the moment. <br> <br>
                    Thank you for visiting!
